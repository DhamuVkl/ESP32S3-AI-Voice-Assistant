## üìã Overview

This project is a complete DIY AI voice assistant built around the ESP32-S3 microcontroller. It combines custom PCB design, advanced audio processing, and cloud-based AI to create a device that rivals commercial smart speakers in functionality while remaining fully open-source and customizable.

Unlike simple voice-controlled devices, this assistant leverages the **Xiaozhi AI framework** to provide natural language understanding through large language models (LLMs) like Qwen, DeepSeek, and GPT. The system uses a hybrid architecture: lightweight tasks run locally on the ESP32-S3, while computationally intensive AI processing happens on cloud servers.

### Key Highlights

- ‚ú® **Natural Conversation**: Powered by modern LLMs for intelligent, context-aware responses
- üéôÔ∏è **Dual-Microphone Array**: Advanced audio capture with beamforming and echo cancellation
- üîã **Battery Powered**: Complete power management with USB-C charging and portable operation
- üí° **WS2812B LED Ring**: Visual feedback with customizable animations
- üè† **Smart Home Ready**: Integration with Home Assistant and other platforms
- üîß **Fully Customizable**: Open hardware and software for endless possibilities
- üì± **Web-Based Control**: Easy configuration through Xiaozhi console
- üåê **Multi-Language**: Support for multiple languages depending on AI model

### PCB Design

The custom PCB is a 2-layer design measuring approximately 80x60mm with careful attention to:
- Signal integrity for I¬≤S audio
- Power distribution with minimal noise
- Thermal management for power ICs
- Acoustic isolation between microphones and speaker


### 3D Enclosure

The enclosure is designed for FDM 3D printing with features for:
- Acoustic optimization (speaker grille, microphone ports)
- LED light diffusion ring
- USB-C and button access
- Battery compartment
- Ventilation slots

**üñ®Ô∏è 3D Files**:
- `enclosure/base.stl` - Bottom tray
- `enclosure/top.stl` - Top cover
- `enclosure/led-ring.stl` - LED diffuser
- `enclosure/assembly.step` - Full assembly (STEP format)

**Printing Recommendations**:
- Material: PLA or PETG
- Layer Height: 0.2mm
- Infill: 20%
- Supports: Required for speaker grille

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**Hardware Tools**:
- Soldering iron and supplies
- Multimeter for testing
- USB-C cable (data capable)
- 3D printer (optional, for enclosure)

**Software Requirements**:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [ESP-IDF Extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=espressif.esp-idf-extension)
- ESP-IDF v5.4 or newer
- Git

### Step 1: Hardware Assembly

1. **Order PCB**: Upload `hardware/gerbers/gerbers.zip` to JLCPCB, PCBWay, or ALLPCB
2. **Source Components**: Use the BOM to order parts from DigiKey, Mouser, or LCSC
3. **Assemble PCB**: Follow the [assembly guide](docs/ASSEMBLY.md) for soldering instructions
4. **3D Print Enclosure**: Print the STL files and assemble

**Detailed Assembly Guide**: [docs/ASSEMBLY.md](docs/ASSEMBLY.md)


### Step 2: WiFi Configuration

On first boot, the device creates a WiFi access point:

1. Connect to WiFi network: `Xioazhi`
2. Navigate to `http://192.168.4.1`
3. Enter your WiFi credentials
4. Device will restart and connect to your network

**Alternative**: Configure WiFi via `idf.py menuconfig` before flashing

### Step 3: Xiaozhi Cloud Setup

1. Create account at [xiaozhi.me](https://xiaozhi.me)
2. Navigate to [Console ‚Üí Agents](https://xiaozhi.me/console/agents)
3. Click "Add Device" to generate Device ID and Pairing Code
4. Device will auto-pair on first cloud connection
